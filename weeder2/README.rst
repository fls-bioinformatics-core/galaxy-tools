Automated installation
======================

Installation via the Galaxy Tool Shed will take of installing the tool wrapper and
the Weeder2 program and data, and setting the appropriate environment variables.

Manual Installation
===================

There are two files to install:

- ``weeder2_wrapper.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)
- ``weeder2_wrapper.sh`` (the shell script wrapper)

The suggested location is in a ``tools/weeder2/`` folder. You will then
need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the tool
by adding the line:

    <tool file="weeder2/weeder2_wrapper.xml" />

You also need to make a copy of the ``weeder2.loc`` file (a sample version is
provided here) which lists the species for which frequency files are available.
This file should be placed in the ``tool-data`` directory of your Galaxy
installation.

Additionally you will need to install ``weeder2`` from:

- http://159.149.160.51/modtools/downloads/weeder2.html

The tool wrapper uses the following environment variables in order to find the
appropriate files:

- ``WEEDER_FREQFILES_DIR`` should point to the ``FreqFiles`` directory

Also the directory holding the Weeder2 executables should be on your ``PATH``.

Functional tests
================

If you want to run the functional tests, copy the sample test files under
sample test files under Galaxy's ``test-data/`` directory. Then:

    ./run_tests.sh -id weeder2

You will need to have set the environment variables above.

Reference Data
==============

Weeder2 requires reference data in the form of frequency files for each
species of interest. A set of reference files is provided as part of the
Weeder2 installation.

Additional frequency files can be generated for novel species using the
``w2frequency_maker`` utility available via:

- http://159.149.160.51/weederaddons/weeder2freq.html

This page also explains what input data should be used.

The location of the additional frequency files can then be specified by
adding them to the ``weeder2.loc`` file (see above).

History
=======

========== ======================================================================
Version    Changes
---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0.1      - Explicitly specify frequency files in ``weeder2.loc``.
2.0.0      - Initial version
========== ======================================================================


Developers
==========

This tool is developed on the following GitHub repository:
https://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/galaxy-tools/tree/master/weeder2

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball I use
the ``package_weeder2.sh`` script.
