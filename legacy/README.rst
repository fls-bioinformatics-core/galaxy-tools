"Legacy" tools
==============

The ``legacy`` directory holds old versions of tools which are no
longer being supported, have been superseded, or which are now being
developed elsewhere.

 * ``data_manager_mothur_toolsuite``: now pushed to the
   `galaxproject/tools-iuc (https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc)`_
   repository (see `pull request 585 (https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/pull/585)`_

 * ``rnachipintegrator``: version which pre-dates the change of format
   for the ``.loc`` file used for the "canonical genes" tool.
   Current version of the tool is in the ``tools`` subdirectory.
