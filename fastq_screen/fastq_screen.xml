**What it does**

fastq_screen maps a set of reads from a FASTQ file sequence dataset against a set of
bowtie indexes for different organisms, and should be run as part of a QC pipeline.

It works with both Illumina (i.e. Sanger formatted) and SOLiD (i.e. colorspace) data;
note that the available screen sets may vary depending on the format of the input
FASTQ file.

fastq_screen reports the percentage of mapped reads against each index as both a textual
table and as a plot (in PNG format), giving an indication of how much of each organism
is present in the sample and revealing sources of contamination.

**Options**

It is recommended to use just a subset of reads in the search, in order to speed up the
screening for large datasets. To use all reads, leave the subset size blank.

(Note that if the fastq_screen decides that the subset is too small, or if the specified
subset exceeds the number of reads in the input dataset, then the value will be
over-ridden).
