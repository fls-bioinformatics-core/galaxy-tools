pal_finder: find microsatellite repeats and design PCR primers
==============================================================

Galaxy tool wrapper for the pal_finder microsatellite and PCR primer design script.

Automated installation
======================

Installation via the Galaxy Tool Shed will take of installing the tool wrapper and
the pal_finder and primer3_core programs (plus additional dependencies), and setting
the appropriate environment variables.

Manual Installation
===================

There are three files to install:

- ``pal_finder_wrapper.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)
- ``pal_finder_wrapper.sh`` (the shell script wrapper)
- ``pal_finder_filter_and_assembly.py`` (filtering utility)

The suggested location is in a ``tools/pal_finder_wrapper/`` folder. You will then
need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the tool
by adding the line::

    <tool file="pal_finder/pal_finder_wrapper.xml" />

You will also need to install the pal_finder and primer3 packages:

- ``pal_finder`` can be obtained from http://sourceforge.net/projects/palfinder/
- ``Primer3`` version 2.0.0-alpha (see the pal_finder installation notes) can be
  obtained from http://primer3.sourceforge.net/releases.php

Additionally the filtering script needs ``BioPython`` and the ``PANDASeq`` program:

- ``BioPython`` can be obtained from https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/b/biopython/
- ``PANDASeq`` version 2.8.1 can be obtained from https://github.com/neufeld/pandaseq/

The tool wrapper must be able to locate the ``pal_finder_v0.02.04.pl`` script, the
example pal_finder ``config.txt`` and ``simple.ref`` data files, and the
``primer3_core`` program - the locations of these are taken from the following
enviroment variables which you will need to set manually:

- ``PALFINDER_SCRIPT_DIR``: location of the pal_finder Perl script (defaults to /usr/bin)
- ``PALFINDER_DATA_DIR``: location of the pal_finder data files (specifically config.txt
  and simple.ref; defaults to /usr/share/pal_finder_v0.02.04)
- ``PRIMER3_CORE_EXE``: name of the primer3_core program, which should include the
  full path if it's not on the Galaxy user's PATH (defaults to primer3_core)

If you want to run the functional tests, copy the sample test files under
sample test files under Galaxy's ``test-data/`` directory. Then::

    ./run_tests.sh -id microsat_pal_finder

You will need to have set the environment variables above.

History
=======

========== ======================================================================
Version    Changes
---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

0.02.04.5  - Update to handle large output files which can sometimes be generated
             by the ``pal_finder_v0.02.04.pl`` or ``pal_filter.py`` scripts (logs
             of hundreds of Gb's have been observed in production): log files
             longer than 500 lines are now truncated to avoid downstream problems. 
0.02.04.4  - Update to the filter script (``pal_filter.py``) which removes some
             columns from the output assembly file.
0.02.04.3  - Update to the Illumina filtering script from Graeme Fox (including
             new option to run ``PANDASeq`` assembly/QC steps), and corresponding
	     update to the tool; add support for input FASTQs to be a dataset
	     collection pair.
0.02.04.2  - Fix bug that causes tool to fail when prefix includes spaces;
             add explicit dependency on Perl 5.16.3.
0.02.04.1  - Add option to run Graeme Fox's ``pal_finder_filter.pl`` script to
             filter and sort the pal_finder output (Illumina input data only).
             Update version number to reflect the pal_finder version.
0.0.6      - Allow input data to be either Illumina paired-end data in fastq
             format or single-end 454 data in fasta format.
0.0.5      - Allow custom mispriming library to be specified; added
             ``tool_dependencies.xml`` file to install pal_finder and primer3
             programs  and configure environment for Galaxy automatically.
0.0.4      - Added more custom options for primer3_core for selecting primers on
             size, GC and melting temperature criteria.
0.0.3      - Check that pal_finder script & config file, and primer3_core
             executable are all available; move PRIMER_MIN_TM parameter to new
             "custom" section for primer3 settings
0.0.2      - Updated pal_finder_wrapper.sh to allow locations of pal_finder Perl
             script, data files and primer_core3 program to be set via environment
             variables
0.0.1      - Initial version

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball I use
the ``package_pal_finder.sh`` script.
