**What it does**

This tool takes three GFF files containing the positions genomic features, typically transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and looks for clusters with certain properties.  The GFF file input could be different TFBS (e.g. combinatorial binding of different factors) or the same TFBS (clustering of multiple instances of the same factor).  

The cluster properties are explained in more detail in the **Options** section.

**Options**

'TFBS GFF files' - Each file contains genomic coordinates, typically matches between an IUPAC string representing a TFBS and a set of target sequences, such as those from a ChIP-seq experiment.  However, the positions could be for any genomic feature over the whole genome.  The important thing is that the different files have the same genome build in common.

'Minimum occurrence of TFBS' - When clusters are determined you can ensure that a minimum number off occurrences from each TFBS are present.

'Identifier for TFBS' - This allows information about the different TFBS sets to be propogated through to the output.  The identifier could be the TFBS name or the IUPAC used to search for the sites, this should only include letters/numbers, but without spaces.

'Minimum length of clusters' - The length is a window of sequence in which the specified number of TFBS must be located.  Initially TFBScluster will identify all cluster matching the input criteria.  It will then merge any overlapping clusters, which can result in lengths greater than the input length.

'Include or exclude overlapping TFBS' - You can choose to exclude any TFBS that overlaps with another when counting the number of co-occurring TFBS.  By default such TFBS are excluded as a basic assumption about co-occuring/cooperative TFBS in a module is that both factors can bind at the same time, which they are unlikely to do if their binding sites overlap.
