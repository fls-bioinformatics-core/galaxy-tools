**What it does**

This tool will find all matches to a DNA pattern in the input DNA sequence, represented by an IUPAC string. The matches are non-overlapping, so searching with 'TTTT' in 'TTTTTTTT' will find two hits to the IUPAC. The output is in GFF format and the last 'attribute' field can be specified using the 'Label' option.

IUPAC = Nucleotide(s):

A = A
 
C = C

G = G

T = T

M = A/C

R = A/G

W = A/T

S = C/G

Y = C/T

K = G/T

V = A/C/G

H = A/C/T

D = A/G/T

B = C/G/T

N = A/C/G/T

.. class:: infomark

**Options**

'IUPAC string' - can be entered as upper- or lower-case as the tool will force them to become upper-case, but will only accept the IUPAC codes listed above.

'Attribute in GFF output' - the last field of each GFF line 'attribute' can be specified using the 'Label' option, this should only include letters/numbers, but without spaces.

'Select sequence strands to scan' - Only scanning the forward strand of the input sequence is useful if the IUPAC is a palindrome (e.g. CANNTG).
