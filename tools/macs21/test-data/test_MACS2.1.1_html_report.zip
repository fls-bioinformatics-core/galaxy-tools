# control file = ['/tmp/tmpHxmla3/files/000/dataset_2.dat']
# effective genome size = 7.75e+08
# band width = 300
# model fold = [5, 50]
# qvalue cutoff = 5.00e-02
# Larger dataset will be scaled towards smaller dataset.
# Range for calculating regional lambda is: 1000 bps and 10000 bps
# Broad region calling is off
# Paired-End mode is off
# MACS will save fragment pileup signal per million reads
